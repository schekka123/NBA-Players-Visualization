# NBA-Players-Visualization

Data visualization is valuable for analyzing NBA player statistics and helps managers and scouts make informed decisions about signing and trading players. The data was collected from the official NBA website and preprocessed using Python and libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. The data analysis involved computing various statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for the different variables.

Used various data visualization such as radial charts, bar charts, heatmaps, scatter plots, stacked bar charts, comparison tables and 1D/2D visualization techniques that were effective in comparing multiple variables and identifying trends and patterns to analyze the NBA player statistics. The visualization was performed using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
 
Performed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling using machine learning techniques such as clustering and principal component analysis. These comparisions of players helped determine their ability to play in various conditions, and coaches can use this information to improve their performance.
